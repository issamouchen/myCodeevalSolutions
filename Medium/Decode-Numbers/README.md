 You are given an encoded message containing only numbers. You are also provided with the following mapping:

A : 1
B : 2
C : 3
...
Z : 26

Given an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
Input sample:

12

123

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file is a test-case and contains an encoded message of numbers. E.g.

You may assume that the test cases contain only numbers.
Output sample:

2

3

Print out the different number of ways it can be decoded. E.g.

NOTE: 12 could be decoded as AB(1 2) or L(12). Hence the number of ways to decode 12 is 2.
